# Iu Mien Spoken Digits

Collected Iu Mien language dataset of numbers one through ten. Dataset has voice recordings from nine different individuals including myself with varying sets of recordings from each individuals. Predicted numbers on my own voice based on collected datasets. This is starter project to be develop later for command recognitions and or automatic speech recognition.

The project can be used to recognize sounds of Iu Mien numbers and predict the number pronounced.

This project converted audio files into spectrograms for use with Convolutional Neural Network classification task.
